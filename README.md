# Energy-Analytics-using-Naive-Bayes
A PySpark-based classification project that analyzes global energy consumption and predicts whether a country falls into high or low energy usage based on features like population, GDP, fossil fuel use, renewable consumption, and energy efficiency.

What This Project Does:
Cleans and prepares the World Energy Consumption dataset
Creates a binary label using median energy per capita
Builds a Naive Bayes classifier using PySpark MLlib
Tunes smoothing parameters with cross validation
Evaluates accuracy and confusion matrix

Technologies:
PySpark, Python, MLlib, DataFrames, VectorAssembler, CrossValidator

Files Included:
Source code
Dataset (CSV)
Screenshots of output and dashboard

Conclusion:
The model reliably classifies high vs low energy consumption patterns and demonstrates how machine learning can support data-driven energy planning.
